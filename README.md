## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Download and Prepare the Server

1. **Download CodeCraft MCP**
   - Clone or download this repository to your local machine
   - Note the full path where you saved the files (you'll need this later)

2. **Configure Your Project Directory**
   - Open the `package.json` file in the CodeCraft MCP directory
   - Update the `projectDirectory` field to point to your target project:
   ```json
   "projectDirectory": "C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\project"
   ```
   - **Important**: Use double backslashes (`\\\\`) for Windows paths
   - **Example paths**:
     - Windows: `"C:\\\\Users\\\\john\\\\Documents\\\\MyProject"`
     - macOS/Linux: `"/Users/john/Documents/MyProject"`

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the CodeCraft MCP directory
   cd path/to/codecraft-mcp
   
   # Install required packages
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)**
   - Create a `.env` file in the CodeCraft MCP directory
   - Add your GitHub token for repository operations:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

1. **Locate Claude Desktop Configuration**
   
   The configuration file is located at:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   
   *Replace `[username]` with your actual computer username*

2. **Edit the Configuration File**
   
   Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add CodeCraft MCP to the `mcpServers` section:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "codecraft-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\codecraft-mcp\\\\server.js"
         ],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important Notes**:
   - Replace `C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\codecraft-mcp\\\\server.js` with the actual path to your server.js file
   - Use double backslashes (`\\\\`) for Windows paths
   - If you have other MCP servers configured, add CodeCraft MCP alongside them

### Step 3: Launch and Verify

1. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   - **Important**: Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
   - Restart the application to load the new configuration

2. **Verify Connection**
   - Click on the **connectors panel** (usually on the left side or accessible via settings)
   - Look for **"codecraft-mcp"** in the list of available connectors
   - Ensure the toggle switch next to "codecraft-mcp" is **enabled (blue)**
   - If you see "codecraft-mcp" listed and enabled, the server is successfully connected!
   - You can click on the arrow next to "codecraft-mcp" to view available tools

3. **Test the Connection**
   Try asking Claude:
   ```
   "Can you show me the files in my project directory?"
   ```
   
   Claude should respond by using CodeCraft MCP tools to list your project files.
